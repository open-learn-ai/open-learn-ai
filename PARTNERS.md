## For Hiring Companies

### The Problem We Solve

You're drowning in resumes. Candidates claim "AI experience" but can't explain attention. Interviews waste everyone's time filtering basics.

**Our graduates are different:**
- Built neural networks from scratch (not just imported PyTorch)
- Trained language models (not just called APIs)
- Shipped real applications (not just completed tutorials)
- Had code reviewed by peers and maintainers

### What You Get

| Tier | Investment | Benefits |
|------|------------|----------|
| **Talent Access** | Free | Browse graduate portfolios, post to our job board |
| **Priority Hiring** | $500/hire | Early access to graduates, skip resume screen |
| **Sponsor** | $5K/year | Logo placement, shape curriculum, exclusive events |
| **Founding Partner** | $25K one-time | All above + advisory input, co-marketing |

### How It Works

1. **Browse Portfolios**: Every graduate has public work—their micrograd, their trained models, their capstones
2. **Filter by Skills**: Search by module completed, capstone type, tech stack
3. **Direct Connect**: Message candidates through our platform or see their contact info
4. **Skip the Screen**: Our completion = baseline technical competency verified

### Verified Skills

When someone completes our curriculum, they've demonstrated:

| Module | Verified Skill |
|--------|---------------|
| Module 1 | Understands backprop, can build autograd from scratch |
| Module 2 | Can build and train language models |
| Module 3 | Understands tokenization deeply |
| Module 4 | Can train models at scale, understands distributed training |
| Module 5 | Can build production applications: RAG, fine-tuning, deployment |
| Capstone | Can ship—identify problem, build solution, deploy |

## FAQ

### For Companies

**Q: How do you verify completion?**
A: All work is public on GitHub. Capstones are reviewed by maintainers. We check that code is original and demonstrates understanding (not copy-paste).

**Q: What level are graduates?**
A: Entry to mid-level for AI/ML roles. They understand fundamentals deeply but may lack production experience depending on their background. Capstones show what they can build.

**Q: Can we sponsor a specific module?**
A: Yes. Sponsors can fund module development in areas relevant to their hiring needs and get input on content.

### For Learners

**Q: Do I need to complete everything to get a job?**
A: No, but more completion = stronger profile. Minimum for job board access: Module 4 + reviewed capstone.

**Q: Is this a guarantee of employment?**
A: No. We provide skills, portfolio, and connections. You still need to interview well and be a good fit.

**Q: What if I already have experience?**
A: Great! Speed through the modules, build an impressive capstone, contribute back. Your experience + our verification = strong signal.
