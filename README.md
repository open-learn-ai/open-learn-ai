# Open Learn AI

**Build AI. Ship AI. Get Hired.**

An open source AI curriculum designed to get you from zero to building real systems—fast. No prerequisites except curiosity and willingness to build.

---

## Why This Exists

Universities take 2-3 years to approve a curriculum. By then, the field has moved two generations. We can't wait.

This course exists because:
- **Learning by building** beats lectures
- **Portfolio proof** beats credentials
- **Community** beats isolation
- **Speed** beats perfection

Built by researchers, engineers, and practitioners who ship.

## Philosophy

### 1. Build First, Theory As Needed
Every module starts with building something that works. Theory comes when you need it to understand why.

### 2. Proof of Work > Proof of Attendance
No certificates for watching videos. Your capstone projects ARE your credential. Employers can see what you built.

### 3. Progressive Mastery
Start by running inference. End by training models. Each step unlocks the next.

### 4. Open by Default
All content is open source. All contributions are credited. All improvements benefit everyone.

## Curriculum

| Module | What You'll Build | Time |
|--------|-------------------|------|
| **0: First Contact** | Run local LLM, build your first AI app | 1 week |
| **1: The Engine** | Autograd from scratch (micrograd) | 2 weeks |
| **2: Language Models** | Character-level GPT (makemore → nanoGPT) | 3 weeks |
| **3: Tokenization** | BPE tokenizer from scratch | 1 week |
| **4: Training at Scale** | Reproduce GPT-2 124M | 2 weeks |
| **5: Modern Stack** | Fine-tuning, RAG, agents, deployment | 3 weeks |
| **Capstone** | Ship something real people use | 2+ weeks |

**Total: ~14 weeks to job-ready**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python basics (variables, functions, loops)
- Willingness to be confused and push through
- A computer with GPU access (or cloud credits—we'll help)

### Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[org]/open-learn-ai.git
cd open-learn-ai
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start Module 0
cd module-0-first-contact
python lesson_01_run_local_llm.py
```

## How Completion Works

### The Portfolio Path

1. **Complete exercises** - Each module has hands-on coding exercises
2. **Build capstones** - End each module with a project you own
3. **Submit for review** - Community reviews via PR
4. **Ship publicly** - Your capstone goes in the showcase
5. **Get verified** - Completers are listed in `GRADUATES.md` with links to their work

### What Employers See

Not a certificate. A portfolio:
- Your micrograd implementation
- Your trained language model
- Your tokenizer
- Your fine-tuned model
- Your shipped application

**This IS the credential.**
