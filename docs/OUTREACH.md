## Messaging Templates

### For Andrej Karpathy

**Context**: His Zero to Hero series is the foundation. He's explicitly pro-education and open source.

**Channel**: Twitter DM or email if available

**Message**:

```
Hey Andrej,

Building on your Zero to Hero series to create a full open-source AI curriculum
with structured exercises, capstones, and a job pipeline for completers.

Your videos are the core content—we're adding:
- Hands-on exercises with test suites
- Capstone projects that become portfolio pieces
- Contributor incentives (bounties, credit, network access)
- Employer partnerships so completers can actually get hired

Everything MIT licensed. Goal: get kids building, not just watching.

Repo: [link]

Would mean a lot if you could take a look. Even more if you'd share it.

Either way, thank you for making this content. It's exactly what the world needs.

**Backup (public tweet if no response)**:

```
Built an open-source AI curriculum on top of @karpathy's Zero to Hero series.

- Structured exercises with solutions
- Capstone projects → portfolio pieces
- Contributor bounties
- Job pipeline for completers

The content was always there. We're adding the scaffolding.

### For Yann LeCun

**Context**: Vocal about open AI, education access, democratization. Meta's Chief AI Scientist.

**Channel**: Twitter DM, LinkedIn, or mutual connection intro

**Message**:

```
Hi Yann,

Creating an open-source AI curriculum designed to move faster than universities.

Core philosophy:
- Build first, theory as needed
- Portfolio proof > certificates
- Open by default

Using Karpathy's videos as foundation, adding structured exercises and a
job pipeline so completers can actually get hired.

Would value your thoughts—and if you think it's worthwhile, a signal boost
to your audience would help us reach the students who need this most.

### For Jeremy Howard (fast.ai)

**Context**: Pioneer of practical deep learning education. May see us as complementary or competition.

**Channel**: Twitter, fast.ai forums

**Message**:

```
Hi Jeremy,

Big fan of fast.ai's approach—top-down, practical, accessible.

Building something complementary: open-source curriculum focused on
understanding fundamentals by building from scratch (micrograd → nanoGPT →
training real models).

Different angle than fast.ai: we go bottom-up, but share the "just build it"
philosophy.

Would love your feedback on the curriculum structure. And if you think it's
valuable, happy to cross-link with fast.ai resources.

### For General AI Twitter/Community

**Launch tweet thread**:

```
Thread: We built an open-source AI curriculum because universities are too slow.

1/ The problem: By the time a university approves an AI course, the field has
moved 2 generations. Students graduate with outdated knowledge.

2/ Our solution: Open Learn AI
- Build from scratch (micrograd → nanoGPT → real training)
- Exercises with test suites
- Capstones that become portfolio pieces
- Job pipeline for completers

3/ Core philosophy:
- Build first, theory as needed
- Portfolio proof > certificates
- Open by default
- Incentivize contributors

4/ What's in it:
Module 0: Run your first LLM locally
Module 1: Build autograd from scratch
Module 2: Character-level language models
Module 3: Tokenization deep dive
Module 4: Train GPT-2 124M
Module 5: Modern stack (RAG, fine-tuning, deployment)

5/ For contributors:
- Bounties for exercises and modules
- Credit and author attribution
- Network access (private Discord, hiring partners)
- Rec letters from maintainers

6/ For employers:
- Verified graduate portfolios
- Skip the resume screen
- Sponsor modules in areas you're hiring for

7/ Everything is MIT licensed. Fork it. Teach it. Improve it.

We're not competing with universities. We're filling the gap they can't.

If you know students who should be building AI, share this with them.

### For Hacker News (Show HN)

**Title**:
```
Show HN: Open Learn AI – Open source AI curriculum with job pipeline
```

**Post**:
```
We built an open-source AI curriculum because universities take 2-3 years to
approve courses while the field moves in months.

What it is:
- Structured curriculum: micrograd → language models → training GPT-2 → modern stack
- Built on Karpathy's Zero to Hero videos + new exercises and capstones
- Contributor incentives: bounties, credit, network access
- Job pipeline: verified graduates, employer partnerships

Philosophy:
- Build first, theory when you need it
- Your portfolio IS your credential (no certificates)
- Open by default (MIT license)

We're looking for:
- Early learners to go through the content and give feedback
- Contributors to add exercises and improve modules
- Companies interested in hiring from the pipeline

Repo: [link]

Happy to answer questions about curriculum design, incentive structure, or
anything else.

### For Reddit r/learnmachinelearning

**Title**:
```
[Resource] Open source AI curriculum: from micrograd to training GPT-2,
with exercises and job pipeline
```

**Post**:
```
Hey everyone,

Put together an open-source AI curriculum for people who want to actually
understand how this stuff works by building it.

**What's different:**
- You build everything from scratch (autograd, language models, tokenizers)
- Structured exercises with test suites (not just "watch and hope")
- Capstone projects become your portfolio
- Job pipeline for completers (employer partnerships, verified graduates)

**Curriculum:**
- Module 0: Run LLMs locally
- Module 1: Build micrograd (autograd from scratch)
- Module 2: Character-level language models (makemore → nanoGPT)
- Module 3: Tokenization (BPE from scratch)
- Module 4: Train GPT-2 124M
- Module 5: Modern stack (fine-tuning, RAG, deployment)

Based on Karpathy's Zero to Hero series but with added structure, exercises,
and a path to employment.

**Looking for:**
- Feedback from learners
- Contributors (there are bounties!)
- Anyone who wants to learn by building

Link: [repo]

Let me know what you think or if you have questions!
